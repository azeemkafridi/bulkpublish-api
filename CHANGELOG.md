# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2026-05-21)

### Added

- LinkedIn company pages: connect personal profiles **and** organization (company) pages from the dashboard. Both appear in `GET /api/channels` with `accountType` of `personal` or `organization` and are posted to by `channelId` like any other channel.
- Documented all LinkedIn post types — `post`, `multi_image`, `pdf_carousel`, `article` — plus media limits (images JPEG/PNG/GIF ≤10 MB, max 20; MP4 ≤500 MB, 3–1800 s) and the 3,000-character limit.
- `accountType` field on the Channel type (Python SDK; already present in the Node SDK).

### Changed

- `postTypeOverrides` LinkedIn options now list `pdf_carousel` and `article`.

### Removed

- `POST /api/channels/connect-linkedin-page` from the API spec — connecting a LinkedIn page is a one-time dashboard OAuth action, not an API operation. The API lists and posts to already-connected channels.
- `GET /api/channels/:id/options` no longer returns LinkedIn organizations (connection moved to the dashboard OAuth flow).
